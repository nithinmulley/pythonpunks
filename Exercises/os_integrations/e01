Write a python program that takes a list of file extensions and prints all the files from the current directory matching the extension given. The following extensions and meaning should be supported:

    c should find and print all .c and .h file names
    py should find and print all .py and .pyc file names
    pl should find and print all .pl and .pm file names

Bonus: Read extension and meaning from a configuration file.
